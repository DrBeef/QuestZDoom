= WHAT'S HERE =

This source distribution includes libogg and nothing else. Other modules 
(eg, the modules libvorbis, vorbis-tools for the Vorbis music codec,
libtheora for the Theora video codec) contain the codec libraries for
use with Ogg bitstreams.

Directory:

./src  		The source for libogg, a BSD-license inplementation of 
		the public domain Ogg bitstream format

./include       Library API headers


= WHAT IS OGG? =

Ogg project codecs use the Ogg bitstream format to arrange the raw,
compressed bitstream into a more robust, useful form.  For example,
the Ogg bitstream makes seeking, time stamping and error recovery
possible, as well as mixing several sepearate, concurrent media
streams into a single physical bitstream.

= CONTACT =

The Ogg homepage is located at 'https://www.xiph.org/ogg/'.
Up to date technical documents, contact information, source code and
pre-built utilities may be found there.
