Vorbis is a general purpose audio and music encoding format
contemporary to MPEG-4's AAC and TwinVQ, the next generation beyond
MPEG audio layer 3. Unlike the MPEG sponsored formats (and other
proprietary formats such as RealAudio G2 and Windows' flavor of the
month), the Vorbis CODEC specification belongs to the public domain.
All the technical details are published and documented, and any
software entity may make full use of the format without license 
fee, royalty or patent concerns.

This package contains:

* libvorbis, a BSD-style license software implementation of
  the Vorbis specification by the Xiph.Org Foundation 
  (http://www.xiph.org/) 

* libvorbisfile, a BSD-style license convenience library
  built on Vorbis designed to simplify common uses

* libvorbisenc, a BSD-style license library that provides a simple,
  programmatic encoding setup interface 

* example code making use of libogg, libvorbis, libvorbisfile and
  libvorbisenc

WHAT'S HERE:

This source distribution includes libvorbis and an example
encoder/player to demonstrate use of libvorbis as well as
documentation on the Ogg Vorbis audio coding format.

You'll need libogg (distributed separately) to compile this library.
A more comprehensive set of utilities is available in the vorbis-tools
package.
