General information

TiMidity++ is a software synthesizer.  It can play MIDI files by con-
verting them into PCM waveform data; give it a MIDI data along with
digital instrument data files, then it synthesizes them in real-time,
and plays.  It can not only play sounds, but also can save the gener-
ated waveforms into hard disks as various audio file formats.

TiMidity++ is a free software, distributed under the terms of GNU gen-
eral public license.

The history

TiMidity++ is based on TiMidity 0.2i, written by Tuukka Toivonen (He
discontinued development because he was too busy with work), released
on 1995.  No new version of this original project is developed since
then.  Development has been continued by Masanao Izumo et al. in the
new project named TiMidity++. `++' is to show the difference from
original project.
