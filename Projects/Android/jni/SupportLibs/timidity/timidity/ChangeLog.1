From: David Gibson <david@gibson.dropbear.id.au>
Files: timidity/linux_a.c
    The two bugs are both in the linux audio driver. Firstly, the driver opens
    /dev/dsp for both reading and writing, where only writing is necessary.
    Secondly, the code uses hard coded constants 8 and 16 to set the output
    format on /dev/dsp. This fails on big-endian machines such as the PowerPC.
    This patch makes the code use constants #defined by glibc.

Files: interface/ncurs_c.c
    In cmsg(), in ncurs_c.c, there is an #ifdef __BORLANDC__ which adds in
    a nl().  This should be changed to include __WIN32__ && ! __CYGWIN32__,
    since standard Win32 does not do a \r when a \n is issued.
Files: interface/ncurs_c.c interface/vt100_c.c
    Fixed a bug in the lyric display for non .KAR files that have lyrics.
    In every non .KAR file that I have that has lyrics, '\n' are where '\r'
    should be, and '\r' are in very strange places that result in very bad
    positions to do carriage returns.  The '\n' also do bad things to the -int
    display, since the '\n' caues the text to go below the single line of
    output.

    Fixed Tck/Tk interface problem:
	The proc MakeShuffleList is broken. The list of numbers it generates
	has a `hole' in it. This generates an error when the last number in
	the list has been played.
	Also, with Tk, whenever a new song starts, the global X11 selection is
	changed. This is very annoying when I'm just doing some cut-and-paste
	in another application. I can even loose the data I was attempting to
	move. So I changed this behavior in tkpanel.
