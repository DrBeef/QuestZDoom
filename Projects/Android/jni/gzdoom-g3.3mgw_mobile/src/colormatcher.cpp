** Once upon a time, this tried to be a fast closest color finding system.
** It was, but the results were not as good as I would like, so I didn't
** actually use it. But I did keep the code around in case I ever felt like
** revisiting the problem. I never did, so now it's relegated to the mists
** of SVN history, and this is just a thin wrapper around BestColor().
