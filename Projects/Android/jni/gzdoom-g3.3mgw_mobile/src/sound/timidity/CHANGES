This version of TiMidity should contain all the fixes from the
September 25 2003 SDL_mixer CVS snapshot, plus extended GUS patch
support from later SDL_mixer. In addition, it contains these changes
from SDL_sound:

* Removal of much unused or unnecessary code, such as

  + The "hooks" for putting a user interface onto TiMidity.
  + The antialias filter. It wasn't active, and even at 4 kHz I
    couldn't hear any difference when activating it.
  + Removed all traces of LOOKUP_HACK and LOOKUP_INTERPOLATION.
    According to the code comments they weren't very good anyway.
    ("degrades sound quality noticeably"). I also removed the
    disclaimer about the "8-bit uLaw to 16-bit PCM and the 13-bit-PCM
    to 8-bit uLaw tables" disclaimer, since I believe those were the
    tables I removed.
  + Removed LOOKUP_SINE since it was already commented out. I think we
    can count on our target audience having math co-processors
    nowadays.
  + Removed USE_LDEXP since it wasn't being used and "it doesn't make
    much of a difference either way".
  + Removed decompress hack from open_file() since it didn't look very
    portable.
  + Removed heaps of unnecessary constants.
  + Removed unused functions.
  + Assume that LINEAR_INTERPOLATION is always used, so remove all
    code dealing with it not being so. It's not that I think the
    difference in audio quality is that great, but since it wouldn't
    compile without code changes I assume no one's used it for quite
    some time...
  + Assume PRECALC_LOOPS is always defined. Judging by the comments it
    may not make much of a difference either way, so why maintain two
    versions of the same code?

* Made TiMidity look for its configuration file in both /etc and
  /usr/local/lib/timidity. (Windows version remains unchanged.)

* The following files have been removed: controls.c, controls.h,
  filter.c, filter.h, sdl_a.c, sdl_c.c

* Added support for loading DLS format instruments:
	Timidity_LoadDLS(), Timidity_FreeDLS(), Timidity_LoadDLSSong()

This version of TiMidity also contains my own changes for ZDoom:

* Removed readmidi.c: TiMidity is now fed MIDI events directly to
	produce output. The TimidityMIDIDevice class is responsible for
	feeding TiMidity data and collecting output from it. Since
	ZDoom's MIDI parser ignores SysEx messages, so does this TiMidity,
	though this can be changed if necessary.

* Removed all the precalculated math from tables.c in favor of using
	real math functions.
	
* All sample values are now floats, and only a stereo 32-bit float
	output buffer is supported.

* Moved everything into the Timidity namespace.
