** These are different statnums for thinkers. The idea to maintain multiple
** lists for different types of thinkers is taken from Build. Every thinker
** is ticked by statnum, so a thinker with a low statnum will always tick
** before a thinker with a high statnum. If a thinker is not explicitly
** created with a statnum, it will be given STAT_DEFAULT
