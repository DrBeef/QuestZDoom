QuestZDoom
==========

Welcome to the VR port of the popular LZDoom/GZDoom engine for the Oculus Quest.

This is built solely for the Oculus Quest VR HMD and will *not* run on any other device.

The easiest way to install this on your Quest is using SideQuest, a Desktop app designed to simplify sideloading apps and games ( even beat saber songs on quest ) on Standalone Android Headsets like Oculus Quest and Oculus Go. It supports drag and drop for installing APK files!

Download SideQuest here:

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

This is just an engine port; though the apk does contain the shareware version of Doom, not the full game. If you wish to play the full game you must purchase it yourself, steam is most straightforward:  https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/


Copying the Full Game WAD files to your Oculus Quest
----------------------------------------------------

Copy the PAK files from the installed Quake2 game folder on your PC to the /Quake2Quest folder on your Oculus Quest when it is connected to the PC. You have to have run Quake2Quest at least once for the folder to be created and if you don't see it when you connect your Quest to the PC you might have to restart the Quest.



Caveats
-------

WARNING:  There is a good chance that unless you have your VR-legs this will probably make you feel  sick. The moment you start to feel under the weather YOU MUST STOP PLAYING for a good period of time before you try again. I will not be held responsible for anyone making themselves ill.

I have included a teleport mechanism for locomotiom, so I would recommend trying that if you do start to feel unwell.


Controls
--------

All these controls are for right-handed mode and are the basic/default mappings, all button pushes map internally to a key press and they can be easily remapped to any function in the options menu. Furthermore, each button has a secondary mode when the dominant hand grip trigger is pushed. So for example in right-hand mode the A button will open doors (by sending a Space key) but with the grip trigger held down it will send a '' key to the game instead (which can be remapped as desired)


* Open the in-game menu with the left-controller menu button (same irrespective of right/left handed control)
* A Button - Open Door / Switch
* B Button - Jump
* Y Button - 
* X Button - 
* Dominant-Hand Controller - Weapon orientation
* Dominant-Hand Thumbstick - left/right Snap turn, up/down weapon change
* Dominant-Hand Thumbstick click - 
* Dominant-Hand Trigger - Fire
* Dominant Grip Button - 
* Off-Hand Controller - Direction of movement (or if configured settings HMD direction is used)
* Off-Hand Thumbstick - locomotion / teleport
* Off-Hand Trigger - Run
* Off-Hand Grip Button - Weapon Stabilisation - two handed weapon mode
* Off-Hand Thumbstick click -
